           Sometime in the summer of 2010, a decision was taking to add a wing to Srinagar’s SMHS Hospital, formally known as the Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital. Spread over 10 acres of green, it is one of the biggest government hospitals in the heart of the city and a city doctor had just managed to convince the powers that be of the need to integrate mental health services within a general hospital setting. He wanted to take the stigma away from seeking care of mental health and drug abuse, both ever increasing in a city coping with conflict and human rights abuse. The lime-coloured building got a new additional wing in white.

Then one day, the city doctor decided to stop by to have a look at the four-storey white structure taking shape. He walked in to each floor, inspected the wards and then the toilets — still under construction — to realise there were just urinals. When he asked the architect why there wasn’t a facility for women, the architect asked with a confused look, “But you said this will be a de-addiction centre. Female bhi aayengi yahan? (Will women come too?)” The question posed by the architect reflected the concern of the society struggling to acknowledge the incidence of drug abuse, considered haram in Islam.

Addiction and stigma

Here in Srinagar, you cannot have a conversation about mental health and drug abuse without being told, in every conversation, about the work done by Dr. Arshid Hussain. The 40-year-old is the kind of person who can fill a reporter’s notebook in the first 20 minutes of the meeting, leaving you reeling under the onslaught of information about the magnitude of drug abuse and mental health plaguing Kashmiri youth.

As a medical student interested in mental health, Dr. Hussain was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of patients coming in seeking de-addiction services. In a freewheeling conversation in his office, Dr. Hussain speaks about his first brush with female drug-using patients. “It was the graveyard shift and I was sleeping at my desk. I suddenly felt someone lift my hand, which was on top of a medicine box,” he says over tea, juggling three conversations at the same time — with a staff member who was done for the day, a patient wanting to assure him that some politician will bear his expenses, and a journalist who wanted his undivided attention. “The patient had been admitted after seizures. She was stealing pentothal injections from the pharmacy. From right under my nose.” Pentothal is an opioid analgesic, a common painkiller.

           Bimal Gurung and other GJM leaders resigned en masse from the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) — a semi-autonomous administrative body of the Hills — on Friday, with a defiant GJM chief demanding a CBI inquiry into the deaths of three party supporters on June 18.
Gurung who held a press conference at Patlaybas, said: “I am not Kishenji (Maoist leader who was killed by security forces). I am not a Maoist. We have all resigned from GTA, and now it is only Gorkhaland for us. We are protesting democratically.”
“The state government is trying to frame us. Why should we kill our own sons? I demand a CBI inquiry into the matter. We will go for agitations, dharnas, rallies and fast unto death for the cause of Gorkhaland,” said Gurung.
However, the state police had maintained that only one person had died. In the FIR it had lodged into the June 17 violence, police had named Gurung, his wife and other GJM leaders as accused. Gurung also made it clear that there would be no respite from the indefinite strike, which entered its ninth day on Friday.
“Today, we gave a window for school students. But there is no question of a break from the strike. I am prepared to die, but I will see the end of this,” said Gurung. Gurung also stated that GJM would not allow GTA elections to be held in the Hills.
“There is no question. We will not participate, and we will not allow GTA elections,” said Gurung. The GJM has been ruling GTA since 2012 and its five-year term is set to expire this month. The GTA administers Darjeeling, Kurseong, Mirik, some areas of Siliguri sub-division of Darjeeling district and the whole of Kalimpong district.
The GJM has rescheduled an all-party meeting to June 29, prior to which GJM workers will symbolically burn the GTA accord in different places in the hills on June 27. “We are ready to fight for Gorkhaland under the leadership of Bimal Gurung. All Gorkha outfits should leave their flags and go for a united agitation. We must clear our differences,” said Neeraj Zimba, spokesperson of the Gorkha National Liberation Front.
Meanwhile, trouble erupted in Siliguri with locals agitating near the Sikkim National Transport bus depot. Locals protested against Sikkim Chief Minister Pawan Chamling, who wrote a letter to Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, supporting the demand for Gorkhaland.
“What he (Gurung) is doing is unconstitutional. They (GJM) are setting fire to primary health centres and government buildings. He is trying to bring in anarchy,” said state Tourism Minister Gautam Deb.

           To focus on health and wellness segment in brand reintroduction phase

Modern Food Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. (MFEL) plans to penetrate into markets in the North and West where it currently does not have presence, a top company official said.

The firm has also expanded its product range with the introduction of premium breads in Mumbai, one of its biggest markets, it said on Friday. The company, which sells breads under the Modern brand, had recently introduced its new range of breads in the southern and eastern markets.

The company, controlled by private equity major Everstone Group, is eyeing a phase of growth through ‘a comprehensive brand reintroduction and by enhancing the portfolio of products’ targeted at the fast-growing health and wellness segment.

“We have made a conscious decision to focus on the health and wellness segment during the relaunch phase,” Aseem Soni, CEO and board member, Modern Food said.

His team has created “an advanced portfolio of products, keeping in mind the evolving taste of consumers and their changing lifestyles,” he said.

“In terms of overall business perspective, we are looking at a 25% increase in revenue by FY18, and at a goal to grow revenue fourfold by FY2021 to ₹1,000 crore,” he said.

‘Strengthening presence’


To this end, the company plans to strengthen presence in Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka and West Bengal; and expand its presence in the markets in the North and West, where it does not have any presence, he said.

Everstone Group acquired Modern Food from Hindustan Unilever Ltd. in April, 2016

          Google is going to stop reading your Gmail in search of opportunities to sell ads.

The change announced on June 23, 2017 will end a practice that Google has embraced since the company introduced Gmail in 2004. The practice has raised concerns among privacy watchdogs and creeped out some users.

To help finance the free service, Google has been scanning through what Gmail users were discussing and then showing ads connected to some of the topics. Someone writing about running, for instance, might see ads for shoes.

Google still plans to show ads within Gmail. But instead of scanning through email content, the company’s software will rely on other signals to determine which ads are most likely to appeal to each of its 1.2 billion Gmail users.

The Mountain View, California, company said it would stop the ad-driven scanning of Gmail later in 2017.

Google says it’s changing course so its free Gmail service operates more like the subscription version that it has sold to more than 3 million companies. The paid Gmail doesn’t include ads, so the company has never tried to scan the content of those users’ emails for marketing purposes.

Despite that, Google said some of its business customers incorrectly assumed the company was scanning those accounts as well. By ending all scanning, Google hopes to end the confusion and sell Gmail to even more businesses.
 
Gmail now ranks as the world’s largest email service, an indication that most people didn’t care about Google’s scanning methods. Both Microsoft and Apple have publicly skewered Google for having the audacity to mine users’ emails for ad sales, but those attacks didn’t undercut Gmail’s popularity.
